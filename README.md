# Project of a Simple Banking System on Python

Welcome to the SimpleBankingSystemOnPython repository! 

This project is a basic and educational implementation of a banking system written in Python. It serves as a practical example for those learning Python or interested in understanding the fundamental operations of banking systems.

## Functionalities:
Account Balance Display:

The current balance is displayed at the top of the menu for easy reference.

## Deposit Functionality:
Users can deposit money into their account by selecting the deposit option.
The system prompts the user to enter the amount to deposit.
The balance is updated, and the transaction is recorded in the transaction history (extrato).

## Withdrawal Functionality:
Users can withdraw money from their account by selecting the withdrawal option.
The system prompts the user to enter the amount to withdraw.
Withdrawals are limited by a daily limit (limite) and a daily withdrawal count (LIMITES_SAQUES).
The balance is updated, and the transaction is recorded in the transaction history (extrato).

## Transaction History (Extrato):
Users can view their transaction history, which lists all deposits and withdrawals made.
The current balance is also displayed along with the transaction history.

## Exit Option:
Users can exit the system by selecting the exit option.

The system presents a menu with options to deposit, withdraw, view the transaction history, or exit.
Each transaction updates the balance and the transaction history.
